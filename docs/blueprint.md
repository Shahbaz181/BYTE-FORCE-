## Core Features:

- Real-Time Location Sharing: Share your real-time location with trusted contacts for a specified duration.
- Emergency SOS Button: Send an immediate alert to your guardians, including your location and a short audio clip, with a single tap. The app acts as a tool and will help the LLM decide when and if to use the short audio clip.
